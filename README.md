# Backyard

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/senny/backyard.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/senny/backyard)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/senny/backyard)

this project is in a 'work in progress' state. The object creation currently only works with factory_girl.

## Installation

in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'backyard'
```

to configure backyard, you need to create a backyard.rb file in your features/support directory:

```ruby
require 'backyard/cucumber'

Backyard.configure do
  # application specific configuration
  name_attribute :username, :for => :user
  name_attribute :title, :for => [:post, :comment]
end
```

## Usage

Backyard provides a simple dsl to name the models in your cucumber scenarios.

```ruby
put_model(:post, 'How to use Backyard') # create and store a new Post model named 'How to use Backyard'
put_model(:post, 'I am published', {:published => true}) # you can pass additional options for the factory

my_comment = Comment.first
put_model(my_comment, 'My Comment') # you can also store existing models
```

Backyard keeps track of your saved models and you can access them from all the step definitions:

```ruby
get_model(:post, 'How to use Backyard') # returns the stored post instance
```

If you want to write step definitions, which do not care if the model you are referencing exists then you can use the `modelÂ´ method. It will check if the model with the given name exists and if not, it will create a new model for you.

```ruby
model(:user, 'Tester') # this will return the user called 'Tester' if one has been crated, otherwise it will create a new model for you
model(:user, 'Gardener', {:approved => true})  # you can also pass additional attributes for the factories
```

## Examples

The best way, to get an idea of backyard in action, is to peek inside the [cucumber features](https://github.com/senny/backyard/tree/master/features).

## Configuration

Backyard needs to know how to name your models correctly. You can define the rules using the `Backyard.configure` method:

```ruby
Backyard.configure do
  name_attribute :title, :for => :article
end

# Examples
put_model(:article, 'Getting Started with Rails') # this creates an Article instance with the titel: 'Getting Started with Rails'
model(:article, 'Getting Started with Rails') # returns the article created above
model(:article, 'Upgrading to Rails 3') # since no article with the given name has been created it will create one.
```

There are situations when the name of your model is not as simple as setting an attribute. In these circumstances you can register a block to set the name of your model accordingly:

```ruby
Backyard.configure do
  name_for :owner do |name|
    { :user => model(:user, name, {:username => name}) }
  end
end
```

If all users in your system are named with the username attribute you could use the following configuration:

```ruby
Backyard.configure do
  name_attribute :username, :for => :user

  name_for :owner do |name|
    { :user => model(:user, name) }
  end
end

# Examples
put_model(:user, 'John') # creates a User with username: 'John'
put_model(:owner, 'Jane') # creates a Owner with an associated User, which has the username: 'Jane'
```

This will still create Owner models with an associated user, where the username is set to the name of the created Owner model. This configuration has the advantage, that the username is also beeing set if you just create a User model.
